				Flexibility and diversity has opened new horizons for Dubai's economy as the emirate witnessed steady growth in GDP over the past two years.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Dubai's forward looking policies helped the emirate to achieve 3.4 per cent GDP growth in 2011 and 3.8 per cent in 2010, despite a 2.4 per cent contraction in its economy in 2009, according to an economic report issued on Wednesday.
			</p>
			<p>
				The rebound in economic growth was largely due to fiscal and monetary stimulus packages undertaken by the UAE federal authorities as well as the Government of Dubai.
			</p>
			<p>
				Shaikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai and Chairman of the Executive Council, attributes Dubai's ability to keep pace with the rapid regional and international economic developments to the flexibility, diversity and dynamism of its economy in a foreword to the report. Shaikh Hamdan refers to the figures included in the report, as indicators of Dubai's success in overcoming the repercussions of the global crisis, tracing a new phase of development which affirms its position as a global business and financial hub.
